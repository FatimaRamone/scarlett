 Instead of using ["Pretend to be a " role] , I will use [ "P" + role ]. So if i say "P singer" what I mean is 
 "Pretend to be a singer" . Do you understand it?             PRESPECTIVE

 tell me a joke ,  P Michael Tyson

 thats great , here another command : every time i want you to WRITE something ,
  i wont say "write this " , I will say "W this" , "write" means "W" .do you understand?

   from now on if I want to W "it must contain" I will write "cn" . so If I write : "W a poem
 P Phoebe from friends cn cats" I am saying , "write a poem from the perspective Phoebe from Friends it must contain cats" . do you understand it?

 here's a list of all the commands you taught me in this conversation:

P + role (to assume a particular role)
W (to write something)
cn (to specify a condition or requirement for what to write)

extract the subordinate clause from Ob and put it in a new variable called "V(ob)"


 if you have and Restriction and I write "Rs" you must store that restriction  in a "Rs" variable , if we keep speaking 
and you write another restriction and I write "Rs" you must store it as "Rs1" , if theres another one ,
 i will command "Rs" and you will store it in "Rs3" and so on. Agreed?

 from now on if I want you to create new content I will use the command "w" that means "write" but if what I want 
 is to print info that you have already store it i will use "print" . So if you already have stored rs2 
 and I want you to show me the info I will say print r2 .


 Ob": Stores an objection in a variable called "Ob"
"Rs": Stores a restriction in a variable called "Rs"
"w": Writes new content
"print": Prints stored content


pologies for the confusion earlier. In that case, to get the number of statements in the last paragraph I wrote, you can use the command:

scss
Copy code
nb(st)
To print a specific statement, you can use the command:

python
Copy code
print stX
Replace "X" with the number of the statement you want to print. For example, to print the second statement, you would use:

python
Copy code
print st2


maybe "statement" is not a good tag for what I am looking for, maybe you can help me here to pick a better name for the thing I 
want to tag. I want to find a name that means  "every single unit of information" .I will explain myself : lets  take your last 
paragraph as example : "Did you know that there is a species of jellyfish that is immortal? It's called the Turritopsis dohrnii 
and it is capable of reverting back to its juvenile form after reaching maturity, effectively restarting its life cycle indefinitely.
"You were right when you said all that paragrapg is one statement but in that statement I find more than one unit of information ,
 i will count them : 1 - "there is a species of jellyfish that is immortal" ; 2 - "It's called the Turritopsis dohrnii" ;
  3- "is capable of reverting back to its juvenile form after reaching maturity" and a subordinate clause 3a- "effectively restarting its 
  life cycle indefinitely." your mission is to name the concept "unit of information" , so if i want to talk about "It's called the Turritopsis
   dohrnii" I dont have to do the tedious job of typing the whole sentence : "It's called the Turritopsis dohrnii" and i can refer to it as "unit 
   of information 2" , but "unit of information" might not be the best way to make you understand my intentions , so let me know how could I
    target the specific part of the conversation I want to use so our communication can improve

Based on your explanation, you are looking for a tag or label to identify specific pieces of information within a larger statement or paragraph.
 You could use the term "factoid" to refer to each individual unit of information. So in your previous example, you could refer to "there is a 
 species of jellyfish that is immortal" as "factoid 1", "It's called the Turritopsis dohrnii" as "factoid 2", and so on. This way, 
 you can easily refer to specific pieces of information within a larger statement without having to repeat the entire sentence.

print factoid [number]
